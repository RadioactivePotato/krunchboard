# June 26th - Made the schematic (3 hours)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Made the basic schematic with the ISO105 layout, but without the number pad.

Had to use a gpio expander because I was running low on pins

I used [keyboard-layout-editor.com](https://keyboard-layout-editor.com) and [kbfirmware.com](https://kbfirmware.com) to help.

Spent quite a while trying to get the key switches to not overlap, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WXpGTIbxlQ&t=864s) helped a ton!

I switched the diodes and gpio expander from THT to SMT, it might be harder to solder but it's going ot look much better!

# June 28 - Redid the entire schematic (3.5 hours)

I decided to make the function key row closer to the number row, i also switched the oled from 0.96" to 0.91".

I added 5 programmable macro keys on the right and moved the volume knob to the top right.

Unfortunately I had to redo the schematic and pcb because when I changed the size of the keycaps, the column number also changed as well, which basically moved all of the keys to a new column
