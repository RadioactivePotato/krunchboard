# June 26th - Made the schematic (3 hours)

Made the basic schematic with the ISO105 layout, but without the number pad.

Had to use a gpio expander because I was running low on pins

I used [keyboard-layout-editor.com](https://keyboard-layout-editor.com) and [kbfirmware.com](https://kbfirmware.com) to help.
